# Product positioning and messaging

## Primary audience

Ordinary Mac users who use Codex Desktop with more than one authorized personal, work, or client account. They expect a familiar app installation and prefer visible controls over Terminal commands, scripts, environment variables, or config-file editing.

## Job to be done

Before opening Codex Desktop for the next piece of work, choose the correct account from a visible Mac menu and continue with minimal setup.

## Category

A focused Codex account switcher for the Mac menu bar.

## Core promise

**English:** Switch Codex accounts from your Mac menu bar. Add accounts once, then choose when you need them. No Terminal commands or config-file editing.

**简体中文：** 从 Mac 菜单栏切换 Codex 账号。账号添加一次，之后随时选择。无需终端命令，无需修改配置文件。

## Supporting proof

- Distributed as a signed and Apple-notarized DMG.
- Installs like a normal Mac app and uses browser sign-in to add accounts.
- Keeps personal, work, and client accounts clearly labeled in the menu bar.
- Completes the Codex Desktop handoff after the user selects and confirms an account.
- Stores saved account data locally and runs without its own proxy or cloud account service.
- Free, MIT licensed and open source. The [v0.1.10 Apple Silicon DMG](https://github.com/liuzhao1225/codex-account-switcher/releases/tag/v0.1.10) is about 3.2 MB (3,188,599 bytes, verified September 7, 2026).
- Shows weekly usage as decision context, with an optional 5-hour row.

## Claim boundaries

| Use | Avoid | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “Completes the switch after confirmation” | “Automatically rotates accounts” | The user always selects and confirms the target account. |
| “Focused on account switching” | “Only switches accounts” | The app also manages accounts, shows usage, and provides settings. |
| “Small native Mac app” or a release-specific download size | Unmeasured CPU or memory claims | Read the actual GitHub release asset size when updating copy; broad performance claims require benchmarks. |
| “No Terminal commands or config-file editing” | “Zero setup” | The user still installs the app and signs in to each account once. |
| “For accounts you own or are authorized to use” | Usage-limit bypass language | The product selects identities and does not increase limits or change permissions. |
