# Implementation plan

## 1. Delivery strategy

Build the smallest native macOS app that can complete one real A → B account switch. Add Usage and account-management polish only after that path works.

The implementation should remain on one code path. The switch flow includes one bounded pre-commit credential restoration and no general recovery architecture.

## 2. Milestone 1 — native shell and static UI

Deliver:

- SwiftUI app target;
- `MenuBarExtra`;
- account-list popover;
- compact 326-point content width;
- highlighted current row;
- one weekly `Usage` bar per row by default, with an optional 5-hour row;
- equal-width Manage Accounts, Settings, and Quit footer actions;
- in-popover Manage Accounts and Settings pages;
- in-popover switch confirmation page with safe cancel behavior.

Use fixture data matching the HTML prototype.

Exit criteria:

- UI matches the accepted layout;
- the default setting preserves the compact weekly-only layout;
- progress bars are bound to percentage values;
- current state uses row highlight, not a checkmark.

## 3. Milestone 2 — profile files

Implement:

- `AccountStore`;
- `accounts.json` load/save;
- `settings.json` load/save;
- profile-directory creation;
- copy active credential into a profile;
- activate profile credential into `~/.codex/auth.json`;
- user-only file permissions.

Exit criteria:

- two fixture auth files can be saved and activated;
- activation uses temp file plus rename;
- restoration can reinstall a saved profile credential through the same atomic write path;
- no credential backup file, general rollback state machine, journal, or Keychain code exists.

## 4. Milestone 3 — Codex identity integration

Implement:

- Codex executable discovery;
- app-server process wrapper;
- initialize handshake;
- account identity read;
- identity normalization;
- target verification.

Exit criteria:

- a saved profile can be identified by account ID or email;
- an identity mismatch produces a direct error;
- an identity mismatch after activation restores the validated original profile credential and preserves the mismatch error.

## 5. Milestone 4 — direct switch flow

Implement `SwitchService` in the documented order:

```text
preflight
close Desktop
save current
activate target
verify target
commit state
open Desktop
```

Use one `isSwitching` flag and one in-memory `SwitchStage`.

Exit criteria:

- successful A → B and B → A switches;
- running CLI processes are not touched;
- failure injection at every stage stops immediately;
- no later stage executes after a failure;
- verification and registry-commit failures restore the original credential;
- activation failure before replacement does not restore, and reopen failure after commit keeps the target active;
- no retry, startup recovery, or general rollback state machine executes.

## 6. Milestone 5 — Usage windows

Implement:

- profile-specific `CODEX_HOME` app-server calls;
- rate-limit RPC;
- exact 300-minute 5-hour-window extraction;
- six-to-eight-day weekly-window extraction;
- `remainingPercent` calculation;
- reset-time formatting;
- persistent `usage-cache.json`;
- refresh on application launch and every popover opening;
- one reschedulable five-minute refresh timer while the app remains running;
- concurrent single-flight refresh rounds;
- `Usage unavailable` errors.

Exit criteria:

- only an exact 300-minute short window is normalized as 5-hour Usage;
- 4-hour and 6-hour windows are ignored;
- absence of a six-to-eight-day window does not fall back to another window;
- the optional 5-hour fields preserve weekly-only cache compatibility;
- cached Usage remains visible while refresh runs;
- each account row refreshes independently.

## 7. Milestone 6 — account management

Implement:

- add account using a new profile `CODEX_HOME`;
- read identity after login;
- remove inactive profile;
- disable removal of active profile.

Exit criteria:

- added account appears in the main menu;
- removing a profile deletes its directory and metadata;
- filesystem errors are shown directly;
- no deferred cleanup queue exists.

## 8. Milestone 7 — localization and packaging

Implement:

- English strings;
- Simplified Chinese strings;
- System Default language selection;
- launch-at-login registration through `SMAppService.mainApp`;
- app icon and menu-bar icon;
- local `.app` packaging script.

## 9. Milestone 8 — configured providers

Implement:

- provider discovery through `config/read`;
- a separate **Configured Providers** section;
- provider activation through `config/value/write`;
- built-in OpenAI provider activation during account switching;
- bounded provider restoration when activation cannot be verified;
- clear messaging that existing conversations remain provider-bound.

Exit criteria:

- every configured custom provider appears by configured name or readable identifier;
- provider selection restarts Codex Desktop and changes only `model_provider`;
- account selection restores `openai` before identity verification;
- full configuration, including inline credentials, may enter memory; custom-provider credentials are not displayed, logged, or persisted;
- thread databases and rollout files are never edited.

## 10. Suggested first implementation order

```text
AccountProfile
→ AccountStore
→ static AppModel
→ MenuBarPopover
→ DesktopController
→ CodexClient identity and Usage
→ SwitchService
→ CodexConfigurationClient and ProviderSwitchService
→ Manage Accounts
→ localization
```

## 11. Code-review checklist

Before merging MVP code, verify:

- switching function is readable top-to-bottom;
- the bounded verification/commit restoration is the only compensating branch;
- no general rollback state machine exists;
- no transaction journal exists;
- no catch-and-continue behavior exists;
- only exact 300-minute short-duration windows are presented as 5-hour Usage;
- Settings contains launch-at-login, menu-bar percentage, 5-hour Usage, and language controls;
- Manage Accounts and Settings stay inside the popover;
- every new popover opening starts on the account list;
- account management has no rename path;
- cached Usage is loaded before refresh and updated only after success;
- background refresh continues while the popover is closed;
- active account is a row highlight;
- CLI processes are not enumerated or killed;
- errors include the failed stage;
- auth contents are never logged;
- inline provider credentials may enter memory through `config/read`, but are not displayed, persisted, or logged;
- provider switching uses Codex app-server configuration APIs;
- existing conversations are not rewritten to another provider.
