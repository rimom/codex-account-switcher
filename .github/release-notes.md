## Codex Account Switcher for macOS

Codex Account Switcher is a free, open-source menu-bar app for ordinary Mac users with personal, work, or client Codex accounts. Add accounts through browser sign-in once, then choose from the menu bar with no Terminal commands or config-file editing. After confirmation, the app completes the Codex Desktop handoff.

- Add authorized accounts once through browser sign-in.
- Choose and confirm an account from the menu bar.
- Let the app close, switch, verify, and reopen Codex Desktop.
- Keep saved account data on the Mac without automatic account rotation.

### What's new in v0.1.10

- Align all switches, the language menu, and update controls to a shared right edge with consistent native control sizing.
- Use one layout for setting rows, separators, descriptions, and errors; simplify the automatic-update description.
